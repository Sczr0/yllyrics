Running out from our deatiny
I see the pain is growing endlessly
Light and dark entwined the ancient apell
slowly summening the forgetten history
The story cames to meet the ending paint
I can't breathe, feels like it's killing me
Then you save me with a crystal smile
Never will I let it be wreated
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
For all these last memaries
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
For all the sights that unseen
I don't wanna be alone
we shall not be apart in mean
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
till we reach eternity
No more can I beat the pallid waid
since I already know about love
Tell me more about how time goes by
What in history is lie, and what is truth
Though we have been through some tragedies
Still we found something for our own
You show me how powerful we'd be
so I will not give up by any means
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
For all these last memaries
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
For all the sights that unseen
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
I pray,down on my knees
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
For our cherished memories
Sing we a nostalgic song
in a melting yearning tone
I don't wanna be alone
we shall not be apart in mean
We don't need to be alone
face the sadness anymore
Stay here for me,stay here for me now
till we reach eternity
